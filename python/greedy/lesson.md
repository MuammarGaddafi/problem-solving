Greedy algorithms is an optimal algorithm, optimal algorithms are algorithms which seek for maximizing or minimizing a result


so, When the problem suggest finding a solution about minimum or maximum thing, you should start thinking about greedy immediately

There is always only one optimal solution we end up finding through greedy, when it comes to maximum abd minumum, we only have one minimum and one maximum, so greedy suggest only one solution

Those three methods are for solving optimal problems :

Full water container : 

Imagine if the distances between the sticks are not equal, so how will we work with greedy ? We would have to check every pointer move both width and height, and see which is the most costly choice, depending on how much i would lose from my width and height when i move the right and the same as the left, and according to this logic we would make the better choice, so we have the width taken in consideration 

For example : 

If k move right, i would lose 2m in height and 1 meter in width, so 2m square in total, in other hand if i move left i would lose 1m height but 4m width, so 4m square in the area, which make it the worse solution

One of the most important part of greedy algorithms is to identify the greedy criteria we would work with

As we see in this example, we should choose depending on end time of each activity

Conclusion : main steps of greedy algorithms


1- try to trace your thought and the problem and bring into reality to discover the main problem 

2- set the greedy criteria
